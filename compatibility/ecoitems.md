# EcoItems

This allows you to import items created with EcoItems and use them as a base for your Nexo-items (you will keep everything configured with EcoItems and add your own mechanics, textures, 3d models, etc).

```yaml
example_eco:
  itemname: "<gradient:#59A7EA:#F1D2FF>Test"
  ecoitem_id: my_ecoitem_itemid
```
