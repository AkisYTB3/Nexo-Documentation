# ModelEngine - custom mobs

ModelEngine creates a resourcepack which contains all the models and textures for its custom entities\
Nexo will automatically import ModelEngines resourcepack, and merge it into its own.\
Nexo will also remove any Core-Shaders in the pack by default, due to history of breaking packs\
\
You can make Nexo Auto-Import ModelEngine with shaders by disabling `Pack.import.modelengine.exclude_shaders`
