# Other Mechanics

## Miscellaneous

### Backpack

This allows you to turn any item into a backpack.

{% hint style="info" %}
This mechanic might cause duplication issues!\
If you find any please open a [bug-report](all-mechanics.md) and we will fix them as soon as possible!\\
{% endhint %}

```yml
backpack:
  itemname: backpack
  material: PAPER
  Components:
    max_stack_size: 1
  Mechanics:
    backpack:
      rows: 4
      title: "<red>Backpack"                      #Optional, Default: "Backpack"
      open_sound: "entity.shulker.open"       #Optional, Default: "entity.shulker.open"
      close_sound: "entity.shulker.close"     #Optional, Default: "entity.shulker.close"
```

### Misc Mechanic

{% hint style="warning" %}
On 1.20.5+ use the new [FireResistant-Component](../configuration/items-advanced.md) instead of **burns\_in\_x**
{% endhint %}

This mechanic has a bunch of small changes you can make to your item.\
What they each do should be pretty self-explanatory.

```yaml
myitem:
  Mechanics:
    misc:
      breaks_from_cactus: true
      burns_in_fire: true
      burns_in_lava: true
      disable_vanilla_interactions: false
      can_strip_logs: false
      piglins_ignore_when_equipped: false
      compostable: false
      allow_in_vanilla_recipes: true
```

### Commands

This allows you to execute commands (as the console, a player or op player). If this option is not often the most elegant it has the merit of simplifying a lot of things. You can create a cooldown between usages, check if the player has a specific permission and use the item (understand decrease its amount by one when the command is performed).

```yaml
myitem:
  Mechanics:
    commands:
      cooldown: 5 # example cooldown in seconds. This is optional
      permission: "my.awesome.perm" # required permission. This is optional
      one_usage: true # should the amount decrease when used? Default: false
      console:
        # e.g. to kill the player
        - "kill %p%"
      player:
        # e.g. the player performs /spawn
        - "spawn"
      opped_player:
        # e.g. the player gives himself a diamond sword
        - "give diamond_sword 1"
```

### Armor Effects

This allows you to bind a Potion Effect to an armor (or a hat) so that when you equip it you'll get the effect.\
[Here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html) is a list of all potion effect types available.

```yaml
myitem:
  Mechanics:
    armor_effects:
      night_vision: # the potion effect type
        duration: 10
        amplifier: 0
        ambient: true # Makes potion effect produce more, translucent, particles.
        particles: true # whether this effect has particles or not
        icon: true # whether this effect has an icon or not
```

You can also make an effect only apply if the entire set it equipped.

```yaml
myitem:
  Mechanics:
    armor_effects:
      night_vision:
        requires_full_set: true
        ...
```

### clickAction

This mechanic allows you to run various events when a player clicks a block or furniture. It is very customizable, so it also has a [dedicated tutorial page](clickaction-mechanic.md).

### ItemType

```yaml
myitem:
  Mechanics:
    itemtype:
      value: SUPER_MATERIAL # your itemType
```

### Soulbound

With this mechanic, you can avoid the players to lose their item when they die.

```yaml
myitem:
  Mechanics:
    soulbound:
      lose_chance: 0
```

### Custom mechanic

This mechanic allows you to customize events, conditions and actions.\
Since it is a quite rspecial mechanic, it has its [dedicated tutorial page](custom-mechanic.md).

## Combat

    delay: 20000 # in milliseconds (20000ms = 20s)
```

* **lightning\_bolts\_amount**: how many lightning bolts will be spawned?

      height: 3 # high
