# ‚ùì FAQ

## Nexo generates a resourcepack, can I still use my own?

You can merge any resourcepacks into the ResourcePack generated by Nexo.\
You can do so by simply adding the .zip or folder to `Nexo/pack/external_packs`\
and the plugin will merge it into the final ResourcePack and send it to all players.\
Check out the ResourcePack page for a detailed explanation

### NoteBlocks & Tripwires aren't working correctly?

Nexo uses NoteBlocks and TripWires for custom blocks, and thus disables all their vanilla behaviour.\
Noteblock-mechanic does have an option to re-enable this without losing custom blocks, if you go to Nexo/`mechanics.yml`\
If you do not care about Custom Blocks, you can also just disable the noteblock & stringblock-mechanics in `mechanics.yml`

## My textures work when I use OptiFine but not in vanilla

This usually stems from said textures or models using OptiFine only formatting.\
As of Minecraft 1.11, the ResourcePack formatting is very strict.\
Filenames must be all lowercase, cant contain spaces and textures can't exceed 256x256 resolution.
